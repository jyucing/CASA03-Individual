Prior to 2015, the Directorate for Information and Monitoring of Immigration and Emigration (DRCIE) of the Ministry of Public Security of Madagascar recorded the nationalities of visitors for the entire country. For the year 2018, a clear improvement was put in place compared to the collection system for the landing at Nosy-Be Airport. Previously, the DRCIE was only able to issue data from Ivato International Airport.
Therefore, figures for “other countries of the world” currently show the nationalities of non-resident visitors arriving at the six (6) international airports of Toamasina, Sainte-Marie, Antsiranana, Mahajanga, Fort-Dauphin and Tuléar. End of 2018 and all 2019, NosyBe International Airport has 16 flights per week operated by several international companies, which shows a clear increase in the number of tourists from various nationalities, including Italians."
